# Yeshi AI

Yeshi AI is a personalized learning assistant that adapts to each high-school student’s personality, recent test scores and goals while using gamified tasks to maintain motivation. The platform collects learner’s age, grade, interests and personality traits to create a custom learning persona. It then analyzes the last 2–3 exam scores to build a real-score map of strengths and weaknesses and sets SMART goals for improvement.
